Show that the ODE represents an exact ODE.

\nnl First, since $y' \equiv \displaystyle \dv{y}{x}$, we can rewrite the equation and define functions $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ as
$$\underbrace{(1+y^2)}_{M}\dd x + \underbrace{2(x+1)y }_{N}\dd y = 0.$$
Then $\displaystyle \pdv{M}{y} = 2y$ and $\displaystyle \pdv{N}{x} = \pdv{x} \pars{2xy+2y} = 2y$. Since $M_y = N_x$, it is an exact ODE.
