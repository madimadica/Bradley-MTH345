For what values of the constants $m,n,$ and $\alpha$ (if any) is the following differential equation exact? $$x^m y^2 y' + \alpha x^3 y^n = 0$$

\nnl Rewriting $y'$ and defining functions $M$ and $N$ gives us 
$$\underbrace{\alpha x^3 y^n}_{M} \dd x + \underbrace{x^m y^2}_{N} \dd y = 0.$$
In order to be exact, we need $M_y = N_x$. Currently $M_y = \alpha x^3 n y^{n-1}$ and $N_x = mx^{m-1}y^2$. To match $y$'s exponents, we need $n-1=2$, which implies $n = 3$. Similarly, to match $x$'s exponents, we need $m-1 = 3$, which implies that $m = 4$. This results in the equation $4x^3y^2 = 3 \alpha x^3 y^2$, further implying that $\alpha = \dfrac43$.

\nl Thus, $n = 3$, $m = 4$, and $\alpha = \dfrac43$ makes this ODE exact.

% There is also the cases where \alpha, n and m are 0 with others varying
