Let $\mu(x,y)$ be a non-vanishing function. What is the relationship between the slope field of the original ODE and the ODE $\mu M \dd x + \mu N \dd y = 0$? Justify your answer.

\nl The slope fields are the same because the equation is being algebraically manipulated with multiplication of the same function on each side. $\mu$ also needs to be non-vanishing to prevent the limits at infinity from being zero where they otherwise wouldn't be.
