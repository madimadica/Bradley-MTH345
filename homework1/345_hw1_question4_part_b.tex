Why are the solution curves to the original ODE and the ODE $\mu M \dd x + \mu N \dd y = 0$ identical? Briefly explain.

\nl I believe this is true because integration and derivation are linear operators and can be scaled by scalar functions independent of the differential or integral. This most certainly is not the case for a multivariable $\mu$, but that's why we make $\mu$ independent of one variable, rendering it a function on just one variable.
