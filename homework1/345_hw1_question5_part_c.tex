Using the integrating factor, show that the $\mu$-multiplied ODE is exact.

\nnl Multiplying both sides by $\mu$ yields
$$\underbrace{-2xy^{-3}}_{M} \dd x + \underbrace{(3x^2y^{-4} -y^{-2})}_{N} \dd y = 0.$$
Then $M_y = -2(-3)y^{-4} = -6y^{-4}$ and $N_x = 6xy^{-4}$. Since $M_y = N_x$, the ODE is exact.
