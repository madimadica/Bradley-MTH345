Determine the critical (equilibrium) points, and classify each one as asymptotically stable, unstable, or semistable.

\soln Since this is conveniently factored, the critical points are 0, 1, and 2.

\nl Since $y(0) = 0$ and the leading coefficient of the cubic is positive, $\dv{y}{t} < 0$ for all $y < 0$.  

\nl Since $y(1) = 0$, we also know that $\dv{y}{t} > 0$ for all $y \in (0, 1)$ by some theorem in calc 1 or mth420 that deals with roots.

\nl Similarly with the theorem used previously, we know that $\dv{y}{t} < 0$ for all $y \in (1,2)$.

\nl Lastly it is also clear that for $\dv{y}{t} > 0$ for all $y > 2$ by properties of cubics with positive leading coefficients.

\nnl For $y = 0$, it is unstable because any small change diverges from 0. For $y=1$ is stable because any small change converges back to 1. And for $y=2$ it is unstable because any small change diverges from 2.
