Show that $\{ y_1, y_2 \}$ forms a fundamental set of the ODE.

\soln
\begin{align*}
    W(y_1, y_2) &= \detx{t^2}{t{-1}}{2t}{-t^{-2}}\\
    &= (t^2)(-t^{-2}) - (2t)(t^{-1})\\
    &= -1 -2\\
    &\neq 0
\end{align*}
Which means that all $y_{i}$ are linearly independent and 2 LI solutions on a 2nd order ODE span the kernel.
