$y^{(4)} + 2y'' + y = 0$

\soln This can be written as $D^4 + 2D^2 + I = 0$. Factoring this as a quadratic in terms of $D^2$ yields $(D^2 + 1)^2$. The $D^2 +1$ factor results in $\cos x$ and $\sin x$, but because it is multiplicity 2 then we also have $x \cos x$ and $x \sin x$. 

\nl Therefore the general solution is 
\boxed{$$y(x) = c_1 \cos x + c_2 x \cos x + c_3 \sin x + c_4 x \sin x
.$$}
